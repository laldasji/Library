# Library

## An implementation of a personal library created following the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

### You can check out the project [here!](https://laldasji.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

## Features
- **Comprehensive Book Tracking:** Efficiently track your reading progress with a counter for books read versus unread. The system also records detailed information for each book, including title, author, and page count.
- **Cross-Device Compatibility:** Access your personal library seamlessly across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Backend-Ready Architecture:** The front-end dynamically generates elements from an object list, making it easy to integrate with a backend in the future. This setup will support user authentication and data storage once added.
- **Smooth Animations:** Experience fluid and polished transitions when elements are removed. The interface avoids jagged or abrupt animations for a more refined user experience.

## Follow-up
The project will soon feature an active backend, allowing users to create login credentials and securely store their book archives.
